# MarchingCubes

My try on Astroneer-like terrain, in other worlds - marching cubes algorithm.
It's pretty hard on processor when creating, even after threading was implemented, so you can consider this project stopped. Maybe I'll come back when i find a way to optimize it.
 
# Todo
 
- [x] Optimize chunk creating
- [ ] Hide chunks out of range
- [ ] Hide chunks not in FoV
